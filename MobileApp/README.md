This is the Guanaco Business Mobile app.

All the main files are in `MobileApp`.

# Table of Contents

## Run App

simply what we need is to clone our repository and open the 'Mobile App' folder with Android Studio.

```

And the app is ready to be runned and modified.

## Make an .apk file

Now if, after making the necessary changes, we want to generate an .apk file, it is quite simple. We must go to the 'Build' section Build Bundle(s) /APK(s) and finally build APK.

We wait for the following notification to appear and click on the `locate` option

And that's it, we have our app ready to be runned in any android device.
